# Fine-tuning-LLM-for-Emotion-Detection-in-Customer-Reviews
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) to detect **emotions** in customer reviews using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. The model classifies text into multiple emotions like *joy, anger, sadness, fear, love,* and more, enabling better insight into customer sentiment and behavior.
